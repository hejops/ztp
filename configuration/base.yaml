# configs need to be generalisable across dev and prod environments.
# from least abstracted to most 'ergonomic', the options include:
#
# 1. single hardcoded config file
# 2. single base config with multiple env vars
# 3. single base config with multiple env-specific config files, and a single
#    env var determining which env-specific file(s) to load
