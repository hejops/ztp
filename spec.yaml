# DigitalOcean billing:
#
# "Hosting on Digital Oceanâ€™s App Platform is not free - keeping our app and
# its associated database up and running costs roughly 20.00 USD/month. I
# suggest you to destroy the app at the end of each session - it should keep
# your spend way below 1.00 USD. I spent 0.20 USD while playing around with it
# to write this chapter!"
#
# build and deploy, run for ~10 mins costs about 2 cents
